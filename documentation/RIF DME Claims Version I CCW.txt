     NOTE1:  During the Version H conversion this field was
             populated with data through- out history (back to
             service year 1991).
     NOTE2:  During the Version I conversion this field was
             expanded to include inpatient 'full' encounter
             claims (for service dates after 6/30/97).
             Placeholders for Physician and Outpatient encounters
             (available in NMUD) have also been added.

 Claim Payment Amount        	  NUM     12
       
   	Amount of payment made from the Medicare trust fund for the
 	services covered by the claim record.  Generally, the amount
 	is calculated by the FI or carrier; and represents what was
	paid to the institutional provider, physician, or supplier,
 	with the exceptions noted below.  **NOTE:  In some
 	situations, a negative claim payment amount may be pre-
 	sent; e.g., (1) when a beneficiary is charged the full
 	deductible during a short stay and the deductible exceeded
 	the amount Medicare pays; or (2) when a beneficiary is
 	charged a coinsurance amount during a long stay and the
 	coinsurance amount exceeds the amount Medicare pays (most
 	prevalent situation involves psych hospitals who are paid a
 	daily per diem rate no matter what the charges are.)
  
 	Under IP PPS, inpatient hospital services are paid based on
 	a predetermined rate per discharge, using the DRG patient
 	classification system and the PRICER program.   On the IP
 	PPS claim, the payment amount includes the DRG outlier
 	approved payment amount, disproportionate share (since
 	5/1/86), indirect medical education (since 10/1/88), total
 	PPS capital (since 10/1/91).  After 4/1/03, the payment
 	amount could also include a "new technology" add-on amount.
 	It does NOT include the pass-thru amounts (i.e., capital-
 	related costs, direct medical education costs, kidney
 	acquisition costs, bad debts); or any beneficiary-paid
 	amounts (i.e., deductibles and coinsurance); or any
 	any other payer reimbursement.
  
 	Under IRFPPS, inpatient rehabilitation services are paid
 	based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the
 	Case Mix Group (CMG) classification system and the PRICER
 	program.  From the CMG on the IRF PPS claim, payment is
 	based on a standard payment amount for operating and
 	capital cost for that facility (including routine and
 	ancillary services).   The payment is adjusted for wage,
 	the % of low-income patients (LIP), locality, transfers,
 	interrupted stays, short stay cases, deaths, and high
 	cost outliers.   Some or all of these adjustments could
 	apply.  The CMG payment does NOT include certain pass-
 	through costs (i.e. bad debts, approved education
 	activities); beneficiary-paid amounts, other payer reim-
 	bursement,and other services outside of the scope of PPS.
  
 	Under LTCH PPS, long term care hospital services are paid
 	based on a predetermined rate per discharge based on the
 	DRG and the PRICER program.   Payments are based on a
 	single standard Federal rate for both inpatient operating
 	and capital-related costs (including routine and ancillary
 	services), but do NOT include certain pass-through costs
 	(i.e. bad debts, direct medical education, new technologies
 	and blood clotting factors).  Adjustments to the payment
 	may occur due to short-stay outliers, interrupted stays,
 	high cost outliers, wage index, and cost of living adjust-
 	ments.
  
 	Under SNF PPS, SNFs will classify beneficiaries using the
 	patient classification system known as RUGS III.  For the
 	SNF PPS claim, the SNF PRICER will calculate/return the rate
 	for each revenue center line item with revenue center code =
 	'0022'; multiply the rate times the units count; and then
 	sum the amount payable for all lines with revenue center
 	code '0022' to determine the total claim payment amount.
  
 	Under Outpatient PPS, the national ambulatory payment
 	classification (APC) rate that is calculated for each APC
 	group is the basis for determining the total claim payment.
 	The payment amount also includes the outlier payment and
 	interest.
  
 	Under Home Health PPS, beneficiaries will be classified into
 	an appropriate case mix category known as the Home Health
 	Resource Group.  A HIPPS code is then generated
 	corresponding to the case mix category (HHRG).
  
 	For the RAP, the PRICER will determine the payment amount
 	appropriate to the HIPPS code by computing 60% (for first
 	episode) or 50% (for subsequent episodes) of the case mix
 	episode payment.  The payment is then wage index adjusted.
  
 	For the final claim, PRICER calculates 100% of the amount
 	due, because the final claim is processed as an adjustment
 	to the RAP, reversing the RAP payment in full.  Although
 	final claim will show 100% payment amount, the provider will
 	actually receive the 40% or 50% payment. The payment may
 	also include outlier payments.
  
 	Exceptions:  For claims involving demos and BBA encounter
 	data, the amount reported in this field may not just
 	represent the actual provider payment.
  
 	For demo Ids '01','02','03','04' -- claims contain
 	amount paid to the provider, except that special
 	'differentials' paid outside the normal payment system
 	are not included.
  
 	For demo Ids '05','15' -- encounter data 'claims'
 	contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS,
 	instead of the actual payment to the MCO.
  
 	For demo Ids '06','07','08' -- claims contain actual
 	provider payment but represent a special negotiated
 	bundled payment for both Part A and Part B services.
 	To identify what the conventional provider Part A
 	payment would have been, check value code = 'Y4'.   The
 	related noninstitutional (physician/supplier) claims
 	contain what would have been paid had there been no
 	demo.
  
 	For BBA encounter data (non-demo) -- 'claims' contain
 	amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of
 	the actual payment to the BBA plan.
